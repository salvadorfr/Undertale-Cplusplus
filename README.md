## Project overview
This project was all made by my interest in finding out how video games work.
Tried recreating undertale sans boss fight the best i could using only:
  1. C++.
  2. Qt Graphic tools.
  3. Other Qt Libraries.
  4. Linear Algebra Matrix operations.

Even with the use of pure C++ coding, i was able to create some cool features like:
  * 2D interactive objects made entirely with code.
  * Translation, rotation and escalation of 2D objects.
  * HitBoxes creation and interaction.
  * 2D rendering.
  * Managing game run time events.
  * Game over screen.
  * Scoring system.
